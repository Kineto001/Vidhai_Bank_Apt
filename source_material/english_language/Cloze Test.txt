**Passage 1 (Questions 1-5)**

Slums proliferate, and access to basic services like clean water and sanitation becomes a daily struggle for millions. To address this, urban planning must shift from a reactive to a proactive approach. This involves creating a __(33)__ for sustainable urban development that integrates housing, transport, and green spaces.

In literary criticism, the concept of the 'unreliable narrator' is a fascinating tool used by authors to challenge the reader's perceptions. This narrative device features a narrator whose credibility has been seriously __(41)___. The unreliability may stem from psychological instability, a deliberate intent to deceive, or simply a naive or biased worldview. The author drops subtle clues and contradictions, __(42)__ the reader to question the narrator's account and to piece together a more objective version of the truth. This technique creates a sense of ambiguity and forces the reader into a more active, __(43)__ role. Rather than passively accepting the story as presented, the reader must act as a detective, __(44)__ the text for evidence.

**Passage 10 (Questions 46-50)**

The immune system is a remarkably complex network of cells and proteins that defends the body against infection. Its ability to distinguish between self and non-self (pathogens like bacteria and viruses) is __(46)__ to its function. When this self-recognition mechanism fails, it can lead to autoimmune diseases, where the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues. The system also possesses a 'memory', which is the principle behind vaccination. After an initial __(47)__ to a specific pathogen, the immune system 'remembers' it. This allows for a much faster and more effective response upon subsequent encounters, often preventing the disease from developing. However, the immune system can sometimes be __(48)__ by highly adaptive pathogens that constantly change their surface proteins, a strategy employed by the influenza virus. This constant evolutionary battle __(49)__ the dynamic and ever-vigilant nature of our internal defence mechanisms, a system that is both incredibly resilient and __(50)__ fragile.
