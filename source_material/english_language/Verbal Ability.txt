b) was available for comment on the matter
c) pertaining to the sudden nosedive
d) in the country's stock market.
Answer: b (Error: With "Neither...nor," the verb agrees with the subject closer to it. "Secretaries" is plural, so the verb should be "were" instead of "was".)

b) of the market trends, finding the
c) submitted report to be both inadequate
d) and lacking of depth.
Answer: d (Error: The structure "both X and Y" requires parallelism. "inadequate" is an adjective. "lacking of depth" should be "lacking in depth" or more simply, "shallow" to maintain parallelism. The preposition "of" is incorrect with "lacking" in this context.)

a) The economist warned that unless the government takes

a) The manager was impressed by the candidate's ability
b) to not only articulate complex ideas clearly
c) but also his skill in handling

The team's performance in the tournament was **far more better** than anyone had anticipated.

Directions (46-50): Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given below it.

The rise of the gig economy, facilitated by digital platforms, has fundamentally reshaped labor markets globally. Proponents argue that it offers unprecedented flexibility and autonomy, allowing workers to be their own bosses, set their own hours, and choose their assignments. This model can be particularly appealing for those seeking supplementary income or a better work-life balance. Furthermore, it fosters entrepreneurship and innovation, reducing barriers to entry for service providers and creating a more dynamic, responsive market. For consumers, the gig economy often translates into more convenient and affordable services.

However, this paradigm shift is not without its critics, who point to a significant erosion of traditional labor protections. Gig workers are typically classified as independent contractors, a designation that exempts companies from providing benefits like health insurance, paid leave, and retirement contributions. This precariousness is compounded by income volatility and a lack of a clear career progression path. The algorithmic management that governs many platforms can also be opaque and inequitable, with workers having little recourse against decisions that affect their earnings. Consequently, a debate rages on about the need for a new regulatory framework that can balance the innovative potential of the gig economy with the imperative to ensure fair and secure working conditions.

46. What is the primary purpose of the passage?
a) To advocate for the complete abolition of the gig economy.
b) To exclusively praise the benefits of the gig economy for consumers.
c) To present a balanced overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the gig economy.
d) To argue that gig workers should be classified as full-time employees.
Answer: c (The passage clearly presents both the arguments for (first paragraph) and against (second paragraph) the gig economy, making "a balanced overview" the most accurate description.)

47. According to the passage, which of the following is a major criticism leveled against the gig economy?
a) It leads to higher prices for consumers.
b) It stifles innovation and entrepreneurship.
c) It diminishes traditional employment benefits and security for workers.
d) It provides workers with too much autonomy.
Answer: c (The second paragraph explicitly states that critics point to an "erosion of traditional labor protections" and the exemption from providing benefits as a major issue.)

48. The author uses the word "precariousness" in the second paragraph to describe:
a) The physical danger associated with gig work.
b) The financial and professional instability faced by gig workers.
c) The technical difficulty of using digital platforms.
d) The legal challenges faced by platform companies.
Answer: b (The context, which mentions "income volatility and a lack of a clear career progression path," points directly to financial and professional instability.)

49. What can be inferred about the author's stance on the regulation of the gig economy?
a) The author is strongly against any form of regulation.
b) The author believes existing labor laws are sufficient.
c) The author suggests that a new, balanced approach to regulation is necessary.
d) The author believes regulation would destroy the gig economy's innovative spirit.
Answer: c (The last sentence mentions the "debate... about the need for a new regulatory framework that can balance" innovation with worker security, implying the author sees this as the central, unresolved issue and a necessary path forward.)

50. The term "algorithmic management" as used in the passage most likely refers to:
a) A team of managers who are experts in computer algorithms.
b) The use of automated systems and data to assign tasks and evaluate worker performance.
c) A management style that is flexible and adapts quickly.
d) A democratic process where workers vote on platform rules.
Answer: b (The context suggests a system that "governs many platforms" and against which workers have "little recourse," which points to an automated, data-driven system for managing workers, not human managers or democratic processes.)
