The new intern (a)/ who joined last week (b)/ speaks English very fluent (c)/ and is a great asset to the team. (d)
a) a
b) b
c) c
d) d

Answer: c
(Explanation: The verb 'speaks' needs to be modified by an adverb, not an adjective. The correct word is 'fluently'.)

Seldom I have (a)/ witnessed such a (b)/ blatant disregard for (c)/ company regulations and protocols. (d)
a) a
b) b
c) c
d) d

Answer: a
(Explanation: When a sentence begins with a negative adverb like 'Seldom', 'Hardly', 'Never', etc., it must be followed by inversion. The correct structure is 'Seldom have I witnessed'.)

a) Scarcely, than
b) No sooner, when
c) Hardly, then

a) kind enough
b) kindly enough
c) too kind
d) No improvement

Answer: a

Although he worked very hard (a)/ and followed all instructions, (b)/ he could not hardly (c)/ pass the final assessment. (d)
a) a
b) b
c) c

Answer: c
(Explanation: 'Hardly' is a negative adverb. Using 'not' with 'hardly' creates a double negative, which is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase is 'he could hardly pass'.)

a) She performed at the concert brilliant last night.
b) She performed brilliant at the concert last night.
c) She performed brilliantly at the concert last night.
d) She brilliantly performed at the concert last night.

Answer: c
(Explanation: This sentence correctly follows the Adverb of Manner-Place-Time (MPT) rule: 'brilliantly' (Manner), 'at the concert' (Place), 'last night' (Time).)

**7. Choose the correct option to fill in the blank.**
The CEO's decision was _________ criticized by the board, leading to a heated and lengthy debate.
a) bitterly
b) bitter
c) much bitter
d) very bitterly

Answer: a

a) with no delay
b) without any delay
c) without a delay

Answer: b
(Explanation: 'Without' is a negative preposition. Using 'no' with it creates an incorrect double negative. 'Without any delay' is the correct phrase.)

a) a
b) b
c) c
d) d

a) considerable
b) considerably
c) considering

He is **too intelligent to be not selected** for this prestigious role.
a) so intelligent that he will be selected
b) too intelligent to be selected
c) too intelligent not to be selected
d) No improvement

Answer: c
(Explanation: The structure 'too...to' has a negative implication. To express a positive outcome (he will be selected because he is intelligent), the structure must be 'too intelligent not to be selected'.)

**12. Find the error in the given sentence.**
The speaker emphasized (a)/ that the company would go (b)/ through a difficult phase (c)/ in the near future probably. (d)
a) a
b) b
c) c
d) d

Answer: d
(Explanation: The adverb 'probably' is usually placed before the main verb or after the auxiliary verb. A better position would be '...the company would probably go...' or placing it at the very beginning. Placing it at the end of the clause is awkward and generally incorrect in formal writing.)

**13. Which of the following sentences uses the adverb 'only' correctly?**
a) Only the manager can sanction a leave for more than a week.
b) The manager can only sanction a leave for more than a week.
c) The manager can sanction only a leave for more than a week.
d) The manager can sanction a leave only for more than a week.

Answer: a
(Explanation: The placement of 'only' changes the meaning. In option (a), it correctly emphasizes that *no one else but the manager* can sanction the leave, which is the most logical meaning in a corporate context.)

**14. Choose the correct option to fill in the blank.**
He was _______ upset by the news of his transfer to a remote branch.
a) very much
b) much too
c) too muchly
d) very

Answer: b
(Explanation: 'Much too' is used to modify an adjective ('upset'). 'Too much' is used to modify a noun. So, 'much too upset' is correct. 'Very much' is used with verbs (e.g., I like it very much), not typically with this adjective.)

I haven't seen my cousin **late**, so I am not sure how she is doing.
a) lately
b) later
c) latest
d) No improvement

Answer: a

**17. Choose the correct option to fill in the blank.**
Under no circumstances ______ allowed to share your system password with anyone.
a) you are
b) are you
c) you will be
d) you can be

Answer: b
(Explanation: The negative phrase 'Under no circumstances' at the beginning of the sentence requires inversion of the subject and the auxiliary verb. Thus, 'are you' is the correct form.)

a) a
b) b
c) c
d) d

b) He drove carelessly this morning to the office.
c) He carelessly drove to the office this morning.
d) He drove this morning to the office carelessly.

Answer: c
(Explanation: An adverb of manner ('carelessly') can be placed before the main verb ('drove') for emphasis. While 'He drove carelessly to the office this morning' (Manner-Place-Time) is also correct, option (c) is a very common and correct structure, often preferred for fluency.)

I have **never such a confusing document seen** in my entire career.
a) seen never such a confusing document
b) never seen such a confusing document
c) seen such a confusing document never

The chairman of the board (a)/ seldom or ever takes (b)/ a decision without consulting (c)/ his most trusted advisors. (d)
a) a
b) b
c) c

She ran **so fastly** that no one could catch up with her.
a) so fast
b) very fastly
c) much fast
d) No improvement

a) He plays the piano beautifully.
b) She arrived at the venue late.
c) The train is running lately today.
d) The machine works very efficiently.

Answer: c
(Explanation: 'Lately' means 'recently'. The sentence requires the adverb 'late', which means 'not on time'. So, 'The train is running late today' would be correct.)

**25. Choose the correct option to fill in the blank.**
The risk assessment was not conducted _________, which led to the project's ultimate failure.
a) proper
b) as proper
c) properly

Answer: c

Our new marketing head (a)/ speaks five languages (b)/ and also she has lived (c)/ in three different continents. (d)
a) a
b) b
c) c
d) d

Answer: c
(Explanation: The placement of 'also' is awkward. A better and more standard structure would be '...and she has also lived...' or '...and has also lived...'. The redundant pronoun 'she' after 'and' is also slightly unnatural.)

**27. Improve the underlined part of the sentence.**
It is **raining heavy since morning**, so the match will likely be cancelled.
a) raining heavily since morning
b) heavy raining since morning
c) raining since morning heavily
d) No improvement

(Explanation: The negative adverbial phrase 'Nowhere else' at the start of the sentence requires inversion. The correct structure is 'will you find'.)

**29. Choose the correct option to fill in the blank.**
She was able to complete the task _______, despite the constant interruptions.
a) any how
b) any way
c) anyways
d) anyway

Answer: d
(Explanation: 'Anyway' is the correct adverb meaning 'in any case' or 'regardless'. 'Anyways' is informal and generally considered non-standard. 'Any way' (two words) means 'any method'.)

The presentation was **very much interesting**, and it held the audience's attention throughout.
a) much interesting
b) very interesting
c) too interesting
d) No improvement
