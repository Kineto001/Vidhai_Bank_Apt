SBI PO/Clerk Level MCQs: Grammar (Articles)

1.  In the sentence, identify the segment which contains a grammatical error. If there is no error, choose 'No error'.
    The CEO, being (a)/ a man of principle, (b)/ will never compromise on (c)/ the quality of product. (d)
    a) The CEO, being
    b) a man of principle,
    c) will never compromise on
    d) the quality of product.
    Answer: b
    (Explanation: The correct idiom is 'a man of principles' or 'man of principle'. When used without an article, 'man of principle' is correct. With the article 'a', the plural 'principles' is more appropriate, but the most common error pointed out in exams is the omission of the article entirely before such phrases. However, the most subtle error here is that 'a man of principle' is a set phrase. A better phrasing without 'a' would be 'As a man of principle'. The issue is nuanced. A clearer error would be needed. Let's rephrase the question to be less ambiguous for a test. A better question would test a clearer rule. Let's try again. **Revised Question:** Find the part with the error: "He is considered (a)/ as the Darwin of our times (b)/ due to his groundbreaking (c)/ work in evolutionary biology. (d)" The error is 'as'. 'Considered' is not followed by 'as' in this structure. This is a conjunction error, not an article error. Let's stick to pure article errors.
    
    **Revised Question 1:**
    Find the error in the given sentence.
    The Principal has asked us (a)/ to turn off all the lights and fans (b)/ before we leave a school for the day (c)/ to conserve electricity. (d)
    a) The Principal has asked us
    b) to turn off all the lights and fans
    c) before we leave a school for the day
    d) to conserve electricity
    Answer: c
    (Explanation: 'The school' should be used instead of 'a school'. The sentence refers to a specific school, the one the speaker attends/works at. The definite article 'the' is required.)

2.  Select the option that correctly fills in the blank.
    He is not _______ honourable man his supporters believe him to be; his actions betray a deep-seated hypocrisy.
    a) an
    b) a
    c) the
    d) no article needed
    Answer: a
    (Explanation: The word 'honourable' starts with a vowel sound ('o'), so the article 'an' is used.)

3.  Select the option that correctly fills in the blanks.
    _______ wisdom of Solomon is legendary, but _______ wisdom is not a quality possessed by every ruler.
    a) The, a
    b) A, the
    c) The, no article needed
    d) No article needed, the
    Answer: c
    (Explanation: The first blank refers to the specific wisdom of a particular person (Solomon), hence 'The'. The second blank refers to the abstract noun 'wisdom' in a general sense, so no article is used.)

4.  In the sentence, identify the segment which contains a grammatical error.
    The committee appointed (a)/ him manager as he (b)/ possessed the right skills (c)/ for the demanding role. (d)
    a) The committee appointed
    b) him manager as he
    c) possessed the right skills
    d) for the demanding role
    Answer: b
    (Explanation: When a person is appointed to a unique post or rank, the article is omitted. It should be 'appointed him manager', not 'appointed him the manager' or 'a manager'. The given sentence is correct as is, making the question a 'no error' type. To make it an error question: **Revised Question 4:** The committee appointed (a)/ him the manager as he (b)/ possessed the right skills (c)/ for the demanding role. (d). Answer: b. The article 'the' should be omitted before 'manager' in this context.)

5.  Select the option that correctly fills in the blank.

    a) the
    b) an
    c) a

6.  In the sentence, identify the segment which contains a grammatical error.
    My friend, who is (a)/ a connoisseur of fine art, (b)/ believes that a beauty is (c)/ a source of perpetual joy. (d)
    a) My friend, who is
    b) a connoisseur of fine art,
    c) believes that a beauty is
    d) a source of perpetual joy.
    Answer: c
    (Explanation: 'Beauty' is an abstract noun. When used in a general sense, it does not take an article. The sentence should be 'believes that beauty is...'. 'A beauty' would refer to a beautiful person or thing, which doesn't fit the context.)

7.  Select the option that correctly fills in the blank.

    a) a
    b) the

    b) no article needed, a
    c) the, the
    d) an, a
    Answer: b
    (Explanation: 'Reading' is a gerund used as an abstract activity, so no article is needed. 'A book' refers to any book in general, representing the class of objects that are his companions.)

    c) on the uninhabited island
    d) in Pacific Ocean.

    b) to some of the world's highest peaks,
    c) the Mount Everest stands
    d) taller than all the others.
    Answer: c
    (Explanation: The definite article 'the' is used before mountain ranges (the Himalayas, the Alps) but not before individual peaks (Mount Everest, K2). The 'the' before 'Mount Everest' is incorrect.)

    b) an

    a) The Prime Minister, Mr. Sharma,
    b) is scheduled to visit
    c) United Kingdom next month
    d) for a crucial trade summit.
    Answer: c
    (Explanation: 'The' is used before names of countries that are unions, kingdoms, republics, or states (e.g., The USA, The UK, The UAE). It should be 'the United Kingdom'.)

    c) an, the
    d) the, the

    b) have scored above 90 percent,
    c) which is a clear indication of
    d) a difficulty of the examination.
    Answer: d
    (Explanation: The noun 'difficulty' is made specific by the phrase 'of the examination'. Therefore, the definite article 'the' should be used instead of 'a'. It should be 'the difficulty of the examination'.)

    b) rank of a General Manager
    c) after working tirelessly for
    d) over two decades in the company.

    b) that is highly valued,
    c) but the honesty he showed in returning
    d) the lost wallet was truly commendable.
    Answer: a
    (Explanation: When an abstract noun like 'honesty' is used in a general sense, it does not take an article. The sentence should start with 'Honesty is a virtue'. The use of 'the honesty' in part (c) is correct because it refers to a specific instance of honesty.)

    This is _______ unique opportunity to showcase your talent, and you should not miss it for anything.
    a) a
    b) an
    c) the
    d) some
    Answer: a
    (Explanation: The word 'unique' begins with a 'y' sound (a consonant sound), not a vowel sound. Therefore, the article 'a' is used, not 'an'.)

25. In the sentence, identify the segment which contains a grammatical error.
    The Ganges is considered sacred (a)/ by many, but it is unfortunately (b)/ one of the most polluted (c)/ river in the world. (d)
    a) The Ganges is considered sacred
    b) by many, but it is unfortunately
    c) one of the most polluted
    d) river in the world.
    Answer: d
    (Explanation: The phrase 'one of the' is always followed by a plural noun. It should be 'one of the most polluted rivers'.) This is a subject-verb agreement error, not an article error. Let's create a pure article error question.

    **Revised Question 25:**
    In the sentence, identify the segment which contains a grammatical error.
    The Judge in him (a)/ prevailed upon the father (b)/ and he sentenced his own son (c)/ to ten years of imprisonment. (d)
    a) The Judge in him
    b) prevailed upon the father
    c) and he sentenced his own son
    d) to ten years of imprisonment.
    Answer: a
    (Explanation: When a common noun within a person (like the judge, the mother, the patriot) is referred to, it is an abstract quality. The definite article 'the' is correctly used to denote this abstract quality. So, 'The judge in him' and 'the father' (referring to the quality of being a father) are both correct. This sentence has no error. Let's make one with an error.

    **Re-revised Question 25:**
    In the sentence, identify the segment which contains a grammatical error.
    Judge in him (a)/ prevailed upon the father (b)/ and he sentenced his own son (c)/ to ten years of imprisonment. (d)
    a) Judge in him
    b) prevailed upon the father
    c) and he sentenced his own son
    d) to ten years of imprisonment.
    Answer: a
    (Explanation: When a common noun is used to express an abstract quality inside a person, the definite article 'the' must be used. It should be 'The judge in him'.)

    a) a
    b) the

    b) pay the income tax is due to fact
    c) that we did not
    d) receive the payment on time.
    Answer: b
    (Explanation: 'Due to the fact that' is a fixed phrase. The definite article 'the' is missing before 'fact'.)

28. Select the option that correctly fills in the blank.
    She has _______ PhD in astrophysics from a renowned European university.
    a) a
    b) an
    c) the
    d) no article needed
    Answer: a
    (Explanation: Even though 'P' is a consonant, the abbreviation 'PhD' is pronounced with an initial 'p' sound, which is a consonant sound. Therefore, 'a' is the correct article. This can be tricky as some might misapply the vowel-sound rule. Let's choose a better example: "He is ______ M.P. from my constituency." Here 'M.P.' is pronounced 'em-pee', starting with a vowel sound, so 'an' is correct. This is a better test.

    **Revised Question 28:**

    My uncle, who is _______ M.L.A., often visits our town to address public grievances.
    a) a

    a) A first step in a rational solution
    b) to any problem is the
    c) recognition of the fact
    d) that a problem exists.
    Answer: a
    (Explanation: Ordinal numbers (first, second, third, etc.) are preceded by the definite article 'the'. The sentence should start with 'The first step'.)

30. Select the option that correctly fills in the blank.
    _______ more you practice, _______ better you become at any skill.
    a) A, a
    b) The, the
    c) More, better
    d) No article needed, no article needed
    Answer: b
    (Explanation: This is a parallel structure of comparative adverbs. In such constructions ('the more... the more...'; 'the higher... the colder...'), the definite article 'the' is used before both comparative forms.)
