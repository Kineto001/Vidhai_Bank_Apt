(a) Scarcely had the merger been finalized
(b) then the integration challenges began to surface,
(c) threatening the projected synergies and shareholder value.
(d) No error

Answer: b

(a) if
(b) provided that
(c) unless

(a) despite it could
(b) knowing though that it could
(c) even though they knew it could

Answer: c

---

______ had the central bank announced the rate hike ______ the currency markets began to show extreme volatility.
(a) No sooner, than
(b) Neither, nor
(c) Hardly, that

---

**5. In the following sentence, find the part that contains a grammatical error.**
Although the quarterly report indicated strong revenue growth, (a) / but the company's stock price paradoxically fell, (b) / puzzling analysts and investors alike. (c) / No error (d).
(a) Although the quarterly report indicated strong revenue growth,
(b) but the company's stock price paradoxically fell,
(c) puzzling analysts and investors alike.
(d) No error

(a) Consequently
(b) Nevertheless

**Lest he should not miss** the opportunity for a promotion, he volunteered to lead the challenging international project.
(a) Lest he should miss
(b) So that he might not miss
(c) In order for him to not miss
(d) For he may not miss

Answer: a
**Explanation:** "Lest" is a negative conjunction meaning "for fear that". It is correctly followed by "should", but it should not be paired with another negative like "not".

---

The new regulations are complex ______ ambiguous, leading to widespread confusion among the financial institutions required to implement them.
(a) but
(b) yet
(c) and
(d) or

---

**9. In the following sentence, find the part that contains a grammatical error.**
Not only the manager was reprimanded for the oversight (a) / but his entire team was also put on probation (b) / for failing to adhere to the compliance standards. (c) / No error (d).
(a) Not only the manager was reprimanded for the oversight
(b) but his entire team was also put on probation
(c) for failing to adhere to the compliance standards.
(d) No error

Answer: a
**Explanation:** When a sentence begins with "Not only", it requires an inversion of the subject and auxiliary verb. The correct structure is "Not only was the manager reprimanded...".

---

The audit will proceed as planned ______ we receive a direct order from the regulatory authority to halt it.
(a) if
(b) until

**The reason he was denied the loan is because** he had a poor credit history and no stable source of income.
(a) The reason why he was denied the loan is that
(b) Because he was denied the loan is that
(c) The reason for him being denied the loan is because
(d) No improvement

Answer: a

(c) You must adhere strictly to the investment guidelines, so that you risk losing the entire principal amount.
(d) You must adhere strictly to the investment guidelines, as you risk losing the entire principal amount.

Answer: b
**Explanation:** The second sentence presents a negative consequence of not following the first. "Otherwise" (or "or else") is the correct conjunction to show this relationship of condition and consequence.

---

Both the chief financial officer (a) / as well as the chief executive officer were (b) / implicated in the financial scandal that rocked the corporation. (c) / No error (d).
(a) Both the chief financial officer
(b) as well as the chief executive officer were
(c) implicated in the financial scandal that rocked the corporation.

Unless the management does not reconsider its rigid stance on salary negotiations, (a) / the employees' union will have no choice (b) / but to call for a nationwide strike. (c) / No error (d).
(a) Unless the management does not reconsider its rigid stance on salary negotiations,
(b) the employees' union will have no choice
(c) but to call for a nationwide strike.
(d) No error

Answer: a
**Explanation:** "Unless" is inherently negative (meaning "if...not"). Using "do not" with "unless" creates a double negative, which is grammatically incorrect. It should be "Unless the management reconsiders...".

---

**16. Fill in the blank with the most suitable conjunction.**
The economic indicators are positive; ______, investor confidence remains surprisingly low due to political instability.
(a) therefore
(b) moreover
(c) however

---

**17. In the following sentence, a part is underlined. Choose the best replacement.**
**Supposing if the company fails** to secure the next round of funding, it will have to declare bankruptcy within six months.
(a) Supposing that the company fails
(b) Suppose the company fails
(c) In case the company will fail
(d) No improvement

Answer: b
**Explanation:** "Supposing" and "if" have similar meanings and are redundant when used together. "Suppose" or "Supposing" alone is sufficient to introduce the condition.

---

He is neither willing to accept the transfer ______ is he prepared to resign from his position, creating a stalemate with the management.
(a) or
(b) but
(c) nor
(d) and

Answer: c
**Explanation:** The correlative conjunction "Neither" is always paired with "nor". The inversion ("nor is he") is correct as "nor" is introducing a new clause.

---

**19. In the following sentence, find the part that contains a grammatical error.**
As soon as the new policy was implemented by the company, (a) / then there was a significant drop in employee morale, (b) / affecting overall productivity and team cohesion. (c) / No error (d).
(a) As soon as the new policy was implemented by the company,
(b) then there was a significant drop in employee morale,
(c) affecting overall productivity and team cohesion.
(d) No error

Answer: b
**Explanation:** The conjunction "As soon as" does not require a subsequent "then". The use of "then" is superfluous and incorrect.

---

The project was completed ahead of schedule, ______ there were several unforeseen logistical challenges along the way.
(a) because
(b) since
(c) although
(d) therefore

---

He was **so exhausted as he** could barely keep his eyes open during the crucial presentation.
(a) so exhausted that he

(a) He was not only a visionary leader
(b) but an exceptional mentor who
(c) nurtured talent and inspired loyalty among his subordinates.
(d) No error

Answer: d
**Explanation:** The sentence is grammatically correct. The "not only... but also" structure is correctly used ("also" is often omitted when the meaning is clear). The parallelism is maintained ("a visionary leader" and "an exceptional mentor").

---

**24. Choose the conjunction that best connects the two sentences.**
I. The company has a strict non-disclosure policy.
II. You must not discuss project details outside the office.
(a) Nevertheless
(b) Whereas
(c) Therefore
(d) Although

Answer: c
**Explanation:** The second sentence is a logical consequence or result of the first. "Therefore" (meaning 'for that reason') correctly establishes this cause-and-effect relationship.

---

**25. Fill in the blank with the most appropriate conjunction.**
He behaved in a suspiciously generous manner, ______ he were trying to conceal a significant mistake.
(a) like
(b) as
(c) so that

**26. In the following sentence, find the part that contains a grammatical error.**
Neither the regional managers nor the vice-president (a) / were aware of the unauthorized transaction (b) / until the internal auditors flagged it as a major concern. (c) / No error (d).
(a) Neither the regional managers nor the vice-president
(b) were aware of the unauthorized transaction
(c) until the internal auditors flagged it as a major concern.
(d) No error

Answer: b
**Explanation:** With the correlative conjunction "neither...nor", the verb must agree with the subject that is closer to it. The closer subject is "the vice-president" (singular), so the verb should be "was", not "were".

---

**27. In the following sentence, a part is underlined. Choose the best replacement.**
**As he is a majority shareholder, so he** has the power to veto any decision made by the board.
(a) Being a majority shareholder, therefore he
(b) As he is a majority shareholder, he
(c) Because he is a majority shareholder, but he
(d) No improvement

Answer: b
**Explanation:** When a sentence begins with a subordinate clause of reason using "As", "Since", or "Because", the main clause should not begin with "so" or "therefore". The conjunction "so" is redundant.

---

**28. Fill in the blank with the most appropriate conjunction.**
The new software is extremely powerful; ______, it requires extensive training for employees to use it effectively.
(a) on the other hand
(b) in addition
(c) for instance
(d) in the same way

Answer: a
**Explanation:** The sentence presents two contrasting aspects of the software: its power (positive) and its difficulty of use (negative). "On the other hand" is used to introduce a contrasting point of view.

---

**29. In the following sentence, find the part that contains a grammatical error.**
The bank has not yet confirmed the loan approval, (a) / or has it given any indication (b) / about a probable timeline for the decision. (c) / No error (d).
(a) The bank has not yet confirmed the loan approval,
(b) or has it given any indication
(c) about a probable timeline for the decision.

(a) If
(b) Unless
(c) Although
