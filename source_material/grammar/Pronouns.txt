    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: c** (Error: 'their' should be 'his' or 'his/her' because the subject is 'Each', which is singular.)

2.  The bank manager, along with his team of clerks, (a)/ has worked tirelessly to prepare the annual report, (b)/ but they have not yet received (c)/ approval from the head office. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: c** (Error: 'they' refers to the singular subject 'The bank manager'. It should be 'he'.)

3.  Let you and I collaborate on this presentation; (a)/ between you and me, I believe we have a (b)/ higher chance of success than anyone (c)/ else in the department. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: a** (Error: 'I' should be in the objective case 'me' after the verb 'Let'. The correct phrase is 'Let you and me'.)

4.  The person whom we suspected (a)/ to be the culprit turned out to be the one (b)/ who had actually reported the security breach (c)/ to the authorities. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) No error
    **Answer: d** (The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Whom' is the object of the verb 'suspected'.)

5.  One must always be mindful of (a)/ the commitments he makes in his professional life, (b)/ as one's reputation is built (c)/ upon trust and reliability. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: b** (Error: The pronoun should be consistent. If the sentence starts with 'One', the subsequent pronoun should be 'one's', not 'he' or 'his'. The correct phrase is 'the commitments one makes'.)

6.  The committee members found themselves in disagreement, (a)/ so the chairman suggested that the decision be left (b)/ to the CEO and I, as we had the most (c)/ experience with such matters. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: c** (Error: 'I' should be in the objective case 'me' as it is the object of the preposition 'to'. The correct phrase is 'to the CEO and me'.)

7.  He is one of those meticulous managers (a)/ who always ensures that every detail, (b)/ no matter how minor, are attended to (c)/ before a project is launched. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: c** (Error: The verb 'are' should be 'is'. The pronoun error is more subtle: the relative pronoun 'who' refers to 'managers' (plural), so the verb should be 'ensure', not 'ensures'. However, focusing on the pronoun aspect, let's rephrase. A better pronoun-related question would be: He is the only one of those managers (a)/ who have consistently met their targets (b)/. The error is that 'who' refers to 'one', so it should be 'has' and 'his'. Let's stick to the original question, where the antecedent of 'who' is 'managers', making the verb 'ensure' correct. The error is 'are' -> 'is' for 'detail'. To make it a pronoun question: *He is one of those meticulous managers (a)/ who always does their best to ensure (b)/ that every detail is attended to (c)/ before a project is launched. (d)* Answer would be (b) - 'who' refers to managers (plural), so it should be 'do their best' not 'does their best'. Let's go with this rephrased version for clarity.
    
    Rephrased Question: He is one of those meticulous managers (a)/ who always does their best to ensure (b)/ that every detail is attended to (c)/ before a project is launched. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: b** (Error: The relative pronoun 'who' refers to the plural antecedent 'managers', not 'one'. Therefore, the verb should be plural ('do') and the pronoun should be 'their' which is correct. The error is the verb 'does', it should be 'do'.)

8.  Despite the company's recent losses, (a)/ its board of directors remains optimistic (b)/ and have expressed their full confidence (c)/ in the new recovery strategy. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: c** (Error: The subject 'board of directors' is a collective noun acting as a single unit, so the verb should be singular ('has') and the pronoun should be singular ('its'). The correct phrase is 'has expressed its full confidence'.)

9.  The new regulations will affect everyone, (a)/ but the impact will be felt more severely (b)/ by we, the small business owners, (c)/ than by large corporations. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: c** (Error: 'we' should be in the objective case 'us' as it is the object of the preposition 'by'. The correct phrase is 'by us, the small business owners'.)

10. The client whom the legal team was advising (a)/ suddenly decided to withdraw the case, (b)/ what came as a complete surprise (c)/ to everyone involved. (d)
    a) a

11. Neither the regional managers nor the head of operations (a)/ was able to give a convincing explanation (b)/ for their failure to meet (c)/ the quarterly sales targets. (d)
    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: c** (Error: When using 'neither...nor', the pronoun agrees with the nearest antecedent, which is 'the head of operations' (singular). Therefore, 'their' should be 'his' or 'his/her'.)

12. To who should I address this formal complaint (a)/ regarding the discrepancies (b)/ found in the financial statement (c)/ provided by the vendor? (d)
    a) a
    b) b

    a) it
    b) itself

    a) a
    b) b

    a) a
    b) b

    a) a
    b) b
    c) c
    d) d
    **Answer: c** (Error: 'it' is not the best pronoun here. 'This' or 'that' would be more appropriate to refer to the action described in the preceding clause. The most correct phrasing would be 'which was a serious breach'.)
