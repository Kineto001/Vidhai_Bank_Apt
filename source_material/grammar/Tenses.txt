### **Part 1: Error Spotting**

**Instructions:** In the following questions, a sentence is divided into three parts (A), (B), and (C). Read the sentence to find out whether there is any grammatical error related to tenses in it. The error, if any, will be in one part of the sentence. The letter of that part is the answer. If there is no error, the answer is (D).

1. Had the regulator been more vigilant, (A)/ this widespread financial malpractice (B)/ would not have been occurred last year. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: c** (Explanation: The verb 'occur' is intransitive and cannot be used in the passive voice. The correct phrasing is 'would not have occurred'.)

2. The committee is reviewing the documents (A)/ since last Monday and is yet to (B)/ make a final decision on the proposed merger. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: a** (Explanation: The use of 'since last Monday' indicates an action that started in the past and is continuing. This requires the Present Perfect Continuous tense. It should be 'has been reviewing'.)

3. By the time we will get our security clearance (A)/ and enter the high-security zone, (B)/ the confidential briefing will have already begun. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: a** (Explanation: In a time clause beginning with 'By the time' that refers to the future, the verb should be in the Simple Present tense, not the Simple Future. It should be 'By the time we get'.)

4. It is high time that the organization (A)/ realizes its vulnerability to cyber-attacks and (B)/ implemented a more robust security framework. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: b** (Explanation: The structure 'It is high time' is followed by a verb in the Simple Past tense to express what should have already been done. It should be 'realized'.)

5. Having been identified as the primary suspect, (A)/ the employee was not only suspended from his duties (B)/ but was also fining heavily by the disciplinary committee. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: c** (Explanation: The sentence requires the passive voice to match 'was suspended'. It should be 'was also fined heavily'.)

6. The new system, which was installed last month, (A)/ already proved to be far more efficient (B)/ than the one it replaced. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: b** (Explanation: An action that happened in the recent past and has a result in the present is best expressed in the Present Perfect tense. It should be 'has already proved'.)

7. I would have appreciated it (A)/ if you told me about the change in the meeting schedule (B)/ before I rearranged my entire day. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: b** (Explanation: This is a Type 3 conditional sentence ('would have' + past participle). The 'if' clause must be in the Past Perfect tense. It should be 'if you had told me'.)

8. The quarterly report indicated (A)/ that the company's profits did not grow (B)/ as rapidly as the analysts have predicted a year ago. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: c** (Explanation: The main actions ('indicated', 'did not grow') are in the past. The prediction happened before those actions, so it must be in the Past Perfect tense. It should be 'had predicted'.)

9. The Chairman of the Board announced yesterday (A)/ that the company will undertake a major restructuring (B)/ over the next fiscal year to improve profitability. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: b** (Explanation: This is reported speech. Since the reporting verb 'announced' is in the past tense, 'will' in the reported clause should change to 'would' according to the sequence of tenses. It should be 'would undertake'.)

10. Scarcely had the new interest rates been announced (A)/ then a sharp fluctuation was witnessed (B)/ in the stock market and currency exchange rates. (C)/ No Error (D).
   a) A
   b) B
   c) C
   d) D
   **Answer: b** (Explanation: The correct correlative conjunction pair is 'Scarcely...when' or 'Hardly...when'. 'Then' is incorrect. It should be 'when a sharp fluctuation was witnessed'.)

    a) completed, will analyze
    b) will complete, will be analyzing
    c) will have completed, will be analyzing
    d) has completed, is analyzing
    **Answer: c** (Explanation: The Future Perfect ('will have completed') is used for an action that will be finished before a specific time in the future. The Future Continuous ('will be analyzing') is used for an action that will be in progress at that future time.)

    a) has been going on, concluded

    a) had cut
    b) has cut

    a) will be shut down, will be lost
    b) is shutting down, is lost
    c) was shut down, was lost

### **Part 3: Sentence Improvement (Phrase Replacement)**

**Instructions:** In the following questions, a part of the sentence is in **bold**. Choose the best alternative to the bold part to improve the sentence. If the sentence is grammatically correct as it is, choose (d) as your answer.

    a) had been secretly diverting
    b) secretly diverted
    c) has been secretly diverting

    **Answer: a** (Explanation: The action of diverting funds happened over a period of time before another past action (the investigation revealed). This requires the Past Perfect Continuous.)

    a) Had I been
    b) If I were
    c) If I am
    d) No improvement needed

23. The economic policies, which **were been announced** last month, are yet to show any tangible results.
    a) which were announced
    b) which had been announced
    c) which have been announced
    d) No improvement needed
    **Answer: a** (Explanation: 'Were been' is grammatically incorrect. Since there is a specific past time marker ('last month'), the Simple Past Passive ('were announced') is the correct form.)

24. As soon as the RBI **will make** an announcement, the market is expected to react sharply.
    a) makes
    b) made
    c) has made
    d) No improvement needed
    **Answer: a** (Explanation: In a future time clause starting with 'as soon as', 'when', 'if', etc., the Simple Present tense is used, not the Simple Future.)

    a) for the last two quarters
    b) from the last two quarters
    c) in the last two quarters ago
    d) No improvement needed

    a) has been working
    b) had been working
    c) was working
    d) No improvement needed

27. By the end of this year, the research team **will be submitting** its groundbreaking findings on AI.
    a) will submit
    b) will have submitted
    c) submits
    d) No improvement needed
    **Answer: b** (Explanation: The phrase 'By the end of this year' sets a deadline in the future, which requires the Future Perfect tense to indicate an action completed by that time.)

    a) had not completed
    b) will not complete
    c) has not completed
    d) No improvement needed
    **Answer: a** (Explanation: The reporting verb 'stated' is in the past. The action of completing the training (or not) occurred before the past deadline, so the Past Perfect tense is required.)

    a) did not yet agree
    b) has not yet agreed
    c) had not yet agreed
    d) No improvement needed
    **Answer: b** (Explanation: The action started in the past ('for the past month') and its result (or lack thereof) continues to the present. The Present Perfect is used for such situations. Also, 'agree' is a stative verb not typically used in continuous form.)

30. The client was angry because the updated software **was not delivered** on the date that was promised a week earlier.
    a) was not being delivered
    b) has not been delivered
    c) had not been delivered
