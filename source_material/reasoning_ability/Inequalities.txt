Inequalities MCQs for SBI PO/Clerk - Difficult Level

**Directions (1-10):** In these questions, a relationship between different elements is shown in the statements. The statements are followed by two conclusions. Based on the statements, you must decide which of the conclusions follows.

Give answer:
(a) If only conclusion I is true.
(b) If only conclusion II is true.
(c) If either conclusion I or II is true.
(d) If neither conclusion I nor II is true.
(e) If both conclusions I and II are true.

    So, J > M is definitely true. And K > M is definitely true.
    My answer should be (e). Let me re-read the question.
    J ≥ K, K > L, M ≤ L. The combination is J ≥ K > L, and M ≤ L. So, J ≥ K > L ≥ M.
    Conclusion I: J # M means J > M. This is true from J ≥ K > L ≥ M.
    Conclusion II: K # M means K > M. This is true from K > L ≥ M.

    Which set of symbols for the blanks makes 'L > O' definitely true?
    (a) >, =
    (b) ≥, ≥
    (c) >, >

    a) Z>Y≥X=W>V. Y≥W and W>V so Y>V. Y≥W so Y>W not definite. Z>V is true. This also works. Let me refine the question for a unique answer.
    Let's use a clearer question.

    c) S>T=U>V≥W. S>V (T). T>W, so T≥W (T). This works.
    Let me check my logic. For a unique answer.
    The question should be 'S > W' and 'T > V'.
    Expression: S __ T = U __ V ≥ W
    Makes 'S > W' and 'T > V' true?
    a) S>T=U≥V≥W. S>W (T). T≥V (Fails T>V).
    b) S≥T=U>V≥W. S>W (T). T>V (T). This works.
    c) S>T=U>V≥W. S>W (T). T>V (T). This works.
    This type of question needs very careful design. Let's simplify.
