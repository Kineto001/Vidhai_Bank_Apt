Verbal Reasoning MCQs for SBI PO/Clerk (Difficult Level)

Directions (1-5): Read the following passage and answer the questions. Each question asks you to make an inference or identify an assumption based on the information provided.

Passage for Q1-2:
The proliferation of digital platforms has democratized content creation, but it has also created an 'attention economy' where the most outrageous, rather than the most veracious, content often gains the most traction. Algorithms designed to maximize engagement inadvertently favour sensationalism, creating feedback loops that can polarize public opinion. Consequently, the traditional role of journalistic gatekeepers, who once curated information for the public, has been significantly eroded, leaving individuals to navigate a complex and often misleading information landscape on their own.

1. Which of the a following can be inferred from the passage?
a) Journalistic gatekeepers were always unbiased and presented the complete truth.
b) The primary goal of all digital platform algorithms is to polarize public opinion.
c) In the current digital era, the ability to critically evaluate information sources is more crucial than ever for an individual.
d) Content created by professional journalists is no longer available on digital platforms.
Answer: c

2. The argument in the passage relies on which of the following assumptions?
a) The majority of people using digital platforms lack the skills to distinguish between sensationalist and factual content.
b) Maximizing user engagement is inherently detrimental to the well-being of a society.
c) Traditional journalistic gatekeepers are actively trying to regain their role by adopting similar algorithmic strategies.
d) All user-generated content is, by nature, outrageous and misleading.
Answer: a

Passage for Q3-5:
In response to a persistent agrarian crisis, many economists advocate for a structural shift away from agriculture towards manufacturing and services. They argue that farm loan waivers and subsidies are mere palliatives that address symptoms, not the root cause of low farm productivity and disguised unemployment. However, this transition is contingent upon the non-farm sector's capacity to absorb millions of semi-skilled workers, a capacity that has not materialized at the required pace, thereby creating a policy conundrum.

3. Which of the following is a valid conclusion from the passage?
a) Farm loan waivers have proven to be the most effective solution for the agrarian crisis.
b) The manufacturing and service sectors have completely failed to generate any employment.
c) A successful transition of the workforce from agriculture is dependent on factors outside the agricultural sector itself.
d) Economists are unanimous in their belief that subsidies are the root cause of the agrarian crisis.
Answer: c

4. The author's use of the term "policy conundrum" refers to the dilemma of:
a) Choosing between supporting the agricultural sector and the manufacturing sector.
b) Implementing farm loan waivers despite their ineffectiveness.
c) Promoting a structural shift that the economy is not yet equipped to handle.
d) The slow pace of agricultural reforms versus the rapid growth of the service sector.
Answer: c

5. Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument made by the economists mentioned in the passage?
a) A new study shows that recent technological advancements in agriculture have the potential to double farm productivity and create new, high-skilled rural jobs.
b) The service sector has shown a preference for hiring highly-skilled urban workers over semi-skilled rural workers.
c) Many developed nations have a very small percentage of their population engaged in agriculture.
d) Farm loan waivers have been shown to increase consumption in rural areas temporarily.

Directions (11-15): A short paragraph is given followed by four statements. You have to choose the statement that best represents the central idea or can be inferred from the paragraph.

11. The concept of 'sustainability' has often been co-opted by corporations as a marketing tool, a phenomenon known as 'greenwashing'. Companies may highlight a single eco-friendly practice while their core business model remains environmentally detrimental. This selective disclosure misleads consumers who are genuinely trying to make ethical choices, thereby diluting the impact of sincere environmental efforts and fostering cynicism.
a) All corporate sustainability efforts are merely marketing ploys.
b) Consumers are incapable of distinguishing between genuine and fake environmental claims.
c) 'Greenwashing' undermines the credibility of the sustainability movement by creating a trust deficit.

12. In the philosophy of science, the Falsification Principle, proposed by Karl Popper, suggests that for a theory to be considered scientific, it must be testable and conceivably provable false. A theory that cannot be falsified by any conceivable event is not scientific. For instance, the statement "All swans are white" is scientific because it can be falsified by observing a single black swan.
a) A scientific theory is one that has been proven to be true.
b) The Falsification Principle is the only criterion for judging a scientific theory.
c) A key characteristic of a scientific theory is its inherent vulnerability to being disproven.
d) Observing a black swan would prove that all scientific theories are unreliable.
Answer: c

13. Behavioral economics challenges the classical economic assumption of the 'rational actor'. It demonstrates that human decisions are often swayed by cognitive biases, emotions, and social influences. For example, the 'endowment effect' shows that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Such insights suggest that policy interventions can be more effective if they are designed to 'nudge' people towards better choices rather than just assuming rational behavior.
a) Humans are fundamentally irrational and incapable of making good decisions.
b) Classical economics has been entirely replaced by behavioral economics.
c) Understanding psychological biases can lead to more effective policy-making.
d) The 'endowment effect' is the most significant bias in human decision-making.
Answer: c

14. The decline of biodiversity is not merely an aesthetic loss of charismatic species; it represents a critical threat to ecosystem services on which humanity depends. Pollination by insects, water purification by wetlands, and climate regulation by forests are all services provided by healthy, diverse ecosystems. The current rate of species extinction, therefore, is an economic and survival issue, not just an environmental one.
a) The primary reason to conserve biodiversity is to save species like pandas and tigers.
b) The economic value of ecosystem services is now accurately calculated and included in GDP.
c) The loss of biodiversity has direct and severe consequences for human well-being and economic stability.
d) Human activity is the sole cause of biodiversity loss.
Answer: c

15. Stoic philosophy posits that virtue is the only good and that external events, such as health, wealth, or pleasure, are neutral, being neither good nor bad in themselves. The path to 'eudaimonia' (a flourishing life) lies in controlling one's judgments about these externals, not in controlling the externals themselves. The wise person is, therefore, immune to misfortune because their happiness is contingent only on their own virtuous character.
a) Stoicism advocates for a life devoid of pleasure and wealth.
b) A Stoic believes that happiness is achieved by mastering one's internal responses to external circumstances.
c) Misfortune cannot physically affect a person who follows Stoic philosophy.
d) According to Stoicism, having a virtuous character guarantees good health and wealth.
